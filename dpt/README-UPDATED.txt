DrivingPracticeTests.com — Updated Aux Files (Robots, Sitemap, README)

What’s included
- index-homepage-optimized-typography.html  (your homepage with improved readability)
- state-california-pro-typography.html      (your CA hub with improved readability)
- robots.txt                                (allow-all + sitemap pointer)
- sitemap.xml                               (home + CA hub + the six CA tests)

How to deploy
1) Upload the homepage as index.html:
   - Rename index-homepage-optimized-typography.html -> index.html (or copy its contents into your existing index.html).

2) Upload the CA hub:
   - Rename state-california-pro-typography.html -> state-california-pro.html (or copy contents into your existing file).

3) Place robots.txt and sitemap.xml in your site root:
   - https://www.drivingpracticetests.com/robots.txt
   - https://www.drivingpracticetests.com/sitemap.xml

4) Ensure the six CA test pages exist with these exact filenames in your site root:
   - california-dmv-practice-test-1.html
   - california-dmv-practice-test-2.html
   - california-dmv-practice-test-3.html
   - california-dmv-practice-test-4.html
   - california-dmv-practice-test-5.html
   - california-dmv-quick-test.html

5) After deploying, submit sitemap.xml in Google Search Console.

Notes
- Only typography/readability was changed in your two HTML files. Layout and content are the same.
- If you later add more states, add each state hub/test URLs to sitemap.xml and re-submit in Search Console.
