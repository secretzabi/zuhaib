              The Longer Story........
            </h3>
            <div class="fs-28 font-italic mt-16">
              Everything had been leading to this moment…<br> But in 2019, I discovered my Why!

                Oh, I love this story my parents always tell about my primary school days! They would come to pick me up and the first thing to arrive was my school bag, escorted by some lovely girls. Then my lunch bag would arrive with some other sweet girls, and finally, I would arrive surrounded by some amazing girls. Looking back, it's clear that I was always meant to lead women, don't you think?
              </p>
              <p class="mt-32">
                In secondary school, I had so much fun being a leader! I got to be the Assistant Head Girl, Secretary of the Literary and Debating Society, President of the JETS Club, and I was also a star athlete and captain of my Sports House. It was such an exciting time! 
              </p>
              <p class="mt-32">
                When I got to university, I continued to pursue leadership roles and was the Secretary of the Reading University Afro-Caribbean Society (RUACS). It was such a great experience! And to top it off, I competed in a Beauty Pageant and won the title of Miss Malaika UK 2005.

              <p>
                After graduating from university, I moved back to Nigeria to start building my career. I was doing well and occasionally got invited to speak to groups of women. My social life was amazing, my career was growing, 
                and I had a steady romantic relationship (or several romantic relationships, but that's a story for another day... over a glass of wine). Everything seemed to be on track.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-32">
                However, in 2018, I woke up with an "itch" - a feeling of dissatisfaction and restlessness that I couldn't shake off. 
                I didn't know what was causing it, 
                but I felt like there had to be more to life than what I was currently experiencing.
              </p>
              <p class="mt-32">
                I thought that getting another job or a promotion would solve my problem, but of course, I was wrong. 
                I moved to a more senior role in March 2019, and for the first two months, 
                I felt at peace. However, in May 2019, the feelings of restlessness and unease hit me like a ton of bricks.
